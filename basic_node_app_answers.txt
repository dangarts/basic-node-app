1. What is a node module?

A node module is a chunk of code(functions) that may be included in an application.  


2. What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

While both can be used to export a module, `Export` is an extension(alias) of `module.export`.

Usage is usually a users preference, but can be ultimately decided if you want your module to be a specific object type.  

When `require()` is used, it returns `module.export`, not `export`.

Any reassignments of `export` will not be available outside of the module.



3. Why is using `exports` recommended?

Convenient variable where module authors can write less code.

E.g. export.afunctionname vs module.export.afunctionname

In using`exports`, it is not possible to reassign the object within `module.exports`.
